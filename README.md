## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past project. Specifically, I be plotted [weather data](data/processed/cities.csv).

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
