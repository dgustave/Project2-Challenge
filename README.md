## Background

Prepare a dashboard that lays out your theme, coding approach, data munging techniques, and final visualization. Focus on telling a story through data visualizations:

The goal is to get a market insight of the S&P 500 , their individual sectors, and stocks within those sectors for a novice investor. Create a beautiful dashboard with performance graphics, company profiles, and relevant news:

3 questions to answer for my cllient for their own personal dashboard: 

How does S&P 500 index perform? 
What are the top 3;  best value stocks and  fastest earning growth stocks within each sector?  
Display the top 3 company profiles of the S&P 500 sectors for curious investors.


## Novice Investor Dashboard with Attitude

We created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created from external data. 
These visualizations include a Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 
This dashboard should fall into one of the below four tracks: 
A custom “creative” D3.js dashboard containg powerful plots. 
A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly.
A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved).
This dashboard includes at least multiple JS libraries.
This dashboard is powered by a data set with at least 100 records.
This dashboard includes some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
This final visualization includes at least three views.
